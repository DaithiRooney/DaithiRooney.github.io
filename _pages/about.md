About Me
======

My name is David Rooney. Dáithí is what many people refer to me as (pronounced Daa-Hee). It is an Irish name, as I was born and raised outside Dublin. David is totally fine to refer to me as well.

I am currently a doctoral candidate at the Moody School of Communication, University of Texas-Austin. I am on the Rhetoric, Langauge and Political Communication track there under Dr. Johanna Hartelius, where I will defend my dissertation in May 2024.

Current Research
======
I am generally interested in the intersections of environmental communication, animal studies, and critical/cultural studies. In particular, some of my recent research examines how social hierarchies of race, gender, sexuality and more are reproduced through Western norms of appropriate human-animal and, by extension, human-nature relations. 

My dissertation looks at intersections and tensions between new materialist rhetorics of the AI/object and animal rhetorics, trying to outline how discourses of animality constitute human and non-human entities along the lines of religion, race, gender, ability and more. I look  at Trump's medalling of Conan the dog (who assisted in the raid that killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, former leader of ISIL), Elon Musk's plans for his neural technology _Neuralink_ to enmesh humans with AI by moving past symbolic communication into neural-neural connections (what he calls "animal communication), and the first pig-to-human heart transplant from a genetically modified, un-named pig, which occurred in 2022.

Some recently published works examine:

1) Synecdoche in online discourse about Cracker Barrel's introduction of the Impossible Sausage, a plant-based menu option. We outline a framework of _rhetorical gastronativism_ to analyze the way food takes on rhetorical meaning-- in this case, as a "woke" invader. We also suggest, building on previous works connecting meat consumption to ideas about hegemonic masculinity, that the Impossible Sausage stands in for trans contagion for irate Cracker Barrel fans-- a fear that one's gender will melt into fluidity after accidentally eating an Impossible Sausage. in _Rhetoric & Public Affairs_

2) The discursive construction of disease-risk (SARS-CoV-2) in US newspaper coverage of Chinese wet markets. I found that consumption of certain culturally favored animals (e.g., cats, dogs, horses), open-air slaughter and the live sale of animals were taken as evidence of cultural backwardness and propensity for disease, which ignored established high-risk practices, like the pangolin trade, as well as displaced the zoonotic disease risk of industrialized factory farming. in _Environmental Communication_

3) How ecological documentaries risk hierarchalizing environmental damage and producing bias by associating direct harms to individual species across Asia (particularly China and Indonesia) but associated only generalized ecological harm, without showing harm to individuals, with the West. I outline a series of best practices for environmental imagery for threatened species at the end. in _Journalism & Media_ special issue edited by Carrie P. Freeman and Núria Almiron.

Several on-going projects concern: tensions and interconnections between environmental movements and animal rights movements, discourses of meat and plant-based foods, as well as legal rhetoric concerning environmental and other non-human rights.

Other Projects 
======

I also engage in quantitative, public-engaged work on the areas of sustainable food and environmental justice. As avoiding 2°C of warming will be [impossible](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aba7357) without abandoning meat and dairy products, this is a major area of concern that is still underexplored.

Please see the options on the panel above for some recent work of mine in this area.
