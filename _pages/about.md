About Me
======

I am currently a PhD student at the Moody School of Communication, University of Texas-Austin. I am on the Rhetoric, Langauge and Political Communication track there under Dr. Johanna Hartelius.

Current Research"
======
I am generally interested in the intersections of environmental communication, animal studies, and critical/cultural studies. In particular, some of my recent research examines how social hierarchy is reproduced through Western norms of appropriate human-animal and, by extension, human-nature relations. Several on-going projects concern: tensions and interconnections between environmental movements and animal rights movements, discourses of meat and plant-based foods, as well as legal rhetoric concerning environmental and other non-human rights.
