There is often hesitance around food in environmental or climate planning, despite its large impact on local and global environmental systems. There is a perception that attempts to encourage less consumption of meat/dairy will be met with fervent backlash, if not a broader chilling effect on environmental action. This project put that assumption to the test.

This project, funded by _Mercy for Animals_ measured how 1500 citizens of 3 West Coast cities/counties would feel about a policy that would encourage their local city or county government to prioritize buying plant-based foods for hospitals, schools, city events, etc. These jurisdictions were chosen because they have quite significant climate plans (LA County and Eugene) or have some controversy about a _lack_ of a climate plan (Orange County).

We surveyed 500 citizens in each of the 3 jurisdictions with a 5-7 minute survey delivered in early December 2023. Broadly, we found that there is widespread support for such a policy, 71.7% in Eugene, 71.73% in Orange County, and 79% in LA County.
