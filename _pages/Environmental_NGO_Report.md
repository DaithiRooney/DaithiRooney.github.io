This report, funded by _Mercy for Animals_ surveyed environmental NGOs from across the U.S. to understand how to make the harms of animal agriculture a more central issue in environmental messaging. Our report found that staff at environmental NGOs were far more willing to message on this issue than their organizational behavior indicated, including encouraging their audiences to adopt vegan diets, but were hesitant because they lacked experience and messaging materials. We found that the greatest motivator of messaging was public awareness of the harms of animal agriculture, not things like politicians friendly to this issue, scientific reports or strong evidence of the effects of global warming. The report can be found [here](https://go.mercyforanimals.org/l/939853/2023-11-30/4945y/939853/1701366193YwINkysU/Willing_but_Uncertain.pdf) and an interview with me about the report can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KmV3lBTB4oNX0tNlkD9p9K3RM9N5KBSb/view?usp=sharing)
